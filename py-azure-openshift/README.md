# Exercise in Building an Openshift Cluster in Azure
This all started with asking [Pulumi AI](https://www.pulumi.com/ai/) who to build an openshift cluster in Azure using Python.
Also, looking at the example at https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/azure-native/api-docs/redhatopenshift/openshiftcluster/ 
This provided a good framework but it made certain assumptions.

So, we iterated through `pulumi up`s to get to a working version.
