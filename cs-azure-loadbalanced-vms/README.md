# cs-azure-loadbalanced-vms
This project is a "translation" of the ARM template used in [Quickstart: Create a public load balancer to load balance VMs by using an ARM template](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/quickstart-load-balancer-standard-public-template)

It was put together mostly to figure out how get a load balancer properly deployed with the correct:
- Frontend IP configuration
- Backend pools
- Health probes
